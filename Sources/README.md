An arbitrary n*n grid was successfully generated. I used recursive backtracking. Please run the "main.py" for the random maze
generating program. 

Please see the "cell.py", "edge.py", "grid.py", and "mazegenerator.py" files for details. Run the "main.py" for running the program. Remaining files were used for debugging. Please note that the TCP sender has still some bugs, so I have not implemented the program that solves and subsequently sends the solution to a MCU

I am working on sending stream of command streams that will solve the generated maze. So far I have the basic client-server ready, but some timing issues persists.
