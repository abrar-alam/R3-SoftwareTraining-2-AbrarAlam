A arbitrary n*n grid was successfully generated. Hunt and kill (a variation of recursive backtracking algorithm was chosen)
However, a small bug in the hunting step needs to be fixed, which I can do in 1 day. 

Please see the "cell.py", "edge.py", "grid.py", and "mazegenerator.py" files for details. Remaining files were used for debugging

Please see the screenshot of the grid
