A arbitrary n*n grid was successfully generated. I used recursive backtracking. Please run the "main.py" for the random maze
generating program. 

Please see the "cell.py", "edge.py", "grid.py", and "mazegenerator.py" files for details. Remaining files were used for debugging

Please see the screenshot of the grid

I successfully created a client and a server, however, some timing bugs still persist. For example, 
my server fails to decode my sent stream (I see blank strings). This will be fixed in 2 days. I have all the
design ready, which just needs to be implemented
